# Data-Analysis-Portfolio-Projects
Hello! Thank you for taking the time to view my first portfolio project! 
The dataset used in this project is "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Deaths" from https://ourworldindata.org/
In this project, I explore many ways to discover and answer questions about a dataset concerning the effects of Covid-19 on the world.
I added queries that I have recently learned from many sources such as my continuing education classes.
I also plan to continue adding and practicing more queries as I discover them! Please expect to see a Tableau project centered around the information gathered from this project.
Thank you for your time and I hope that you have a great day! 
Please feel free to reach out to me at Christophersun09@gmail.com
